{% capture artist_blurb %}I stumbled on them, a state, a presence, multitudes. Feelings wanted to be heard but I did not let them speak. You are this army of possibilities, unnamed selves.
They share a vessel, together, accumulating life, contained. Seeing different angles of the same story. Whispering in your ears, beating in your heart.
To be, or to blast? That was the question.
Expose my guts, would I feel naked? Ridiculous? or feel something again.
I just wanted to explode in colors, express myself, and one day I pulled that pin, that triggered the UntitledArmy.
This piece is a 1080x1350 px loop and comes with a physical 11"x14" high-quality print signed by the artist. Pros res version of the loop to be provided.
