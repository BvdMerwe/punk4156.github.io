{% capture artist_blurb %}The Prequel to the "Phase Two" triptych; PRECAUTION was the inspiration for my pink Covid-19 themed series. Forced inside by the pandemic, I began to create a series of vector illustrations documenting the current times and posting them on Instagram. My intention was to turn these digital masterpieces into paintings, then back into animations, bringing light to a dark situation. These portal protecting people prefer phasing pandemic particles with photon laser heat guns. Size: 2500px X 2500px Sounds By: Cory Van Lew{% endcapture %}
